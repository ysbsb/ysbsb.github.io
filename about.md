Machine Learning Researcher who likes coffee.

I am doing research on fundamental machine learning and deep learning application for vision and real world.

-------------



I'm MS student at MLVC Lab. Our lab researches about deep leaning architecture and model compression. There are some subject such as model architecture , compression, augmentation, robustness for deep learning, and it can be applicable for super resolution, object detection etc. And I'm in vision task team.

I researched for GAN Compression methods for Model Compression (Core task) + GAN (My domain). I did other optimization and vision projects.
